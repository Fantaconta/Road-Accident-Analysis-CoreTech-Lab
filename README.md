# Road Traffic Accident Analysis Dashboard - UK Data (2021-2022)

## Project Introduction

At CoreTech Labs, we are at the forefront of cutting-edge technology solutions, specializing in software development, AI integration, and data-driven innovations. Our mission is to empower businesses with scalable, intelligent, and efficient digital solutions that drive growth and operational excellence.

Road accidents remain a critical public safety concern, with multiple factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, speed limits, and traffic controls influencing accident severity. However, raw accident data often exists in unstructured formats, making it difficult for stakeholders to derive actionable insights. 

This project was undertaken to perform comprehensive statistical analysis and create an interactive dashboard for better understanding of UK road traffic accident data spanning 2021-2022, covering **307,973 recorded incidents**. The analysis focuses on transforming unstructured accident data into meaningful insights that can guide policy decisions and safety interventions.

**Dataset Overview:**
- **Source:** UK Department for Transport Road Safety Data
- **Time Period:** 2021-2022
- **Records:** 307,973 accident incidents
- **Geographic Coverage:** United Kingdom road network
- **Key Variables:** Number of casualties, vehicles involved, speed limits, road types, time patterns

## Rationale of the Project

### Importance of Analyzing Road Traffic Accidents
Road traffic accidents represent one of the most significant public safety challenges, requiring evidence-based approaches to understand patterns and implement effective interventions. This analysis addresses several critical needs in road safety management.

### Need for Data-Driven Decision Making
Traditional approaches to road safety often rely on intuition or limited anecdotal evidence. By leveraging comprehensive statistical analysis of accident data, we can identify specific risk factors, temporal patterns, and geographical hotspots that require targeted interventions. This data-driven approach ensures that safety resources are allocated based on empirical evidence rather than assumptions.

### Addressing Key Road Safety Challenges
The analysis reveals specific challenges such as night-time driving risks, vehicle-type specific vulnerabilities, and road-type associated dangers. By quantifying these challenges through statistical analysis, we can develop targeted solutions that address the root causes of accidents rather than treating symptoms.

### Enhanced Road Safety Policies
Statistical insights from this analysis provide policymakers with concrete evidence to support new safety regulations, speed limit adjustments, and infrastructure improvements. The findings enable evidence-based policy development that can demonstrably improve road safety outcomes.

### Optimized Resource Allocation
Understanding accident patterns allows transportation authorities to allocate limited safety resources more effectively. By identifying high-risk areas, times, and conditions, authorities can prioritize interventions where they will have the greatest impact on reducing casualties and fatalities.

## Key Insights
### Statistical Summary Overview

This statistical summary provides key descriptive statistics for road accidents in the UK, covering three main variables: Number of Casualties, Number of Vehicles, and Speed Limit. The data shows that on average, there are **1.36 casualties per incident**, **1.83 vehicles involved**, with a mean speed limit of **38.87 mph**, across a total of **307,973 recorded incidents** in 2021-2022.

### Casualty Analysis
- **Average Casualties:** 1.36 per incident with median and mode of 1
- **Distribution Pattern:** Most accidents involve single casualties with few extreme cases
- **Maximum Record:** 48 casualties in a single incident (rare extreme case)
- **Statistical Characteristics:** High kurtosis indicates few extreme cases with very high casualties
- **Interpretation:** The majority of accidents result in single casualties, with extreme multi-casualty events being statistically rare

### Vehicle Involvement Patterns
- **Average Vehicles:** 1.83 vehicles involved per accident
- **Typical Pattern:** Most accidents involve one or two vehicles
- **Maximum Record:** 32 vehicles in a single incident (extremely rare)
- **Distribution:** Highly skewed toward single and two-vehicle accidents
- **Statistical Significance:** Extreme multi-vehicle cases are outliers that occur infrequently

### Speed Limit Analysis
- **Mean Speed Limit:** 38.87 mph across accident locations
- **Range:** Speed limits vary from 10 mph to 60 mph
- **Distribution:** Positive skewness indicates more roads have lower speed limits than higher ones
- **Pattern Recognition:** Lower speed limit roads are more prevalent in the dataset
- **Safety Implication:** Most accidents occur in moderate speed zones rather than high-speed areas

### Temporal Trends and Patterns
#### Year-over-Year Comparison
- **2021 Total Casualties:** 222,146
- **2022 Total Casualties:** 195,737
- **Reduction Rate:** Approximately 12% decrease in road accidents from 2021 to 2022
- **Significance:** Notable improvement in road safety outcomes over the study period
- **Trend Analysis:** Consistent downward trend suggests effective safety interventions

#### Weekly Pattern Analysis
- **Weekday Pattern:** Monday through Friday show higher casualty numbers
- **Weekend Pattern:** Saturday and Sunday demonstrate relatively lower accident rates
- **Contributing Factors:** Higher weekday casualties likely due to increased commuter and work-related traffic
- **Peak Risk Periods:** Weekdays represent higher exposure and risk periods
- **Policy Implication:** Targeted weekday safety interventions may yield significant benefits

## Conclusions
### Major Findings

**Accident Severity Distribution:** The analysis reveals that UK road accidents predominantly involve single casualties (mode = 1) with an average of 1.36 casualties per incident. While most accidents are relatively minor, the presence of extreme cases (up to 48 casualties) highlights the need for comprehensive safety measures across all road types and conditions.

**Vehicle Involvement Patterns:** With an average of 1.83 vehicles per accident, the data confirms that most incidents are single or two-vehicle collisions. The extremely rare cases involving multiple vehicles (up to 32) suggest that while chain-reaction accidents occur, they represent statistical outliers rather than common patterns.

**Speed and Road Design Correlation:** The mean speed limit of 38.87 mph, with positive skewness toward lower speed limits, indicates that accidents frequently occur in moderate-speed environments rather than high-speed motorways. This finding suggests that urban and suburban road design factors may be as critical as speed management in accident prevention.

**Positive Safety Trends:** The 12% reduction in total casualties from 2021 to 2022 demonstrates measurable improvement in UK road safety, suggesting that existing interventions and policies are having a positive impact.

### Statistical Significance
- **Sample Size:** Analysis based on comprehensive dataset of 307,973 incidents ensures statistical reliability
- **Temporal Coverage:** Two-year analysis period provides robust trend identification
- **Variable Diversity:** Multiple analysis dimensions provide comprehensive understanding of accident patterns
